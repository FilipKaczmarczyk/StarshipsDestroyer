# Unity 2D Destruction Fixed
[Unity 2D Destruction](https://github.com/mjholtzem/Unity-2D-Destruction) 
(Made by [mjholtzem](https://github.com/mjholtzem)) fixed missing mesh and material in prefab.

The missing seems to have been issued. because only the stored mesh and material are used 
So I save the mesh and set the material when it destruction.

## HOW TO USE

* Add Explodable component
* Set Extra Points
